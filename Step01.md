### **The integration of data, user interface and logic into webpage functionality**

In 2002, Microsoft founder Bill Gate declared “users should be in control of how their data is being used”. Similar statements from countless technology companies have followed in the years since. Over that time, they have said they would like to protect your privacy and yet default designs and settings and lax security have long left information vulnerable. since the advent of concerns about Google and Facebook’s use of personal data for advertising, companies have pointed out that they don’t sell your data and nonetheless many of the companies' business models are predicated on a targeted advertising model that relies on the continued collection of increasingly personal information. This paper will discuss and analyze how these three webpages (DuckDuckgo, Vimeo, and Walmart) all use data, user interface and logic to make their webpages more user friendly, improve functionality and safety.
DuckDuckGo is a search engine similar to google but DuckDuckGo prides itself on protecting user privacy by not tracking or sharing what people search on the site and emphasizes providing the best search results instead of the most results. Aside from its own search engine, the company also offers browser extensions and apps that block tracking cookies elsewhere on the internet. In the online search business, a space where Google owns or buys up a large chunk of the market share, it seems ethically noble but commercially stupid to run a competing product that sells on the antithesis of a key component of Google’s success formula: keeping tabs on what people search for and recommending ads based on that information. There is a popularity among privacy-minded users, particularly those working in the internet industry about how their data is being used and manipulated and how this translate into what the user sees vs what the user wants. One of the first things you notice when visiting DuckDuckGo, except for the search box, is the subheading “the search engine that doesn’t track you”. DuckDuckGo was built as an alternative to Google and the big search engines that use tracking data to improve personalization. DuckDuckGo reassures its users that they don’t store their personal information. They don’t collect or share personal data. They are not storing your search history, which means that they are not able to sell this data to advertisers. Moreover, there’s no tracking in the private browsing mode, which sounds encouraging for everyone who is interested in a search engine that won’t track every single search.
	Vimeo is a SaaS (Software as a service) ad-free video platform providing free video viewing services as a competitor to YouTube. It is also the first video sharing site to support high definition video. It has launched several product that enable quality video creation at scale, most recently with the launch of vimeo stock. YouTube’s mantra is quantity over quality. Over 301 hours of user footage are uploaded to youtube every single minute, and all of those videos need to be processed before they can go live. In order to handle that kind of load, YouTube must balance compression speed with compression quality. On the other hand, Vimeo’s mantra is quality over quantity. Because Vimeo has stricter guidelines for acceptable videos, its processing load is far lighter than YouTube’s — and that means it can focus more on maximizing the quality of each video using better encoding techniques. If you upload the same video to both YouTube and Vimeo at the same resolution, the Vimeo version will look a lot better because it will have a much higher bitrate. The audio will also sound much better because Vimeo supports 320 Kbps. Unfortunately, these higher quality settings are only available to subscribers of Vimeo Plus, Pro, or Business.
	Walmart is bullish on big data — especially when it comes to finding ways to better serve its shoppers. It is trying hard to compete with amazon and other leading online retailers and at such the company invest on improving its overall user interface. By analyzing shopper’s preferences, Walmart can develop a more consistent, tailored shopping experience. If a customer is shopping for baby products for example, Walmart can use data analytics to anticipate their needs then create personalized mobile rollback deals for these shoppers. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart tweaked its Walmart Pay service to allow customers to reorder the scripts through the app and then skip to the front of the line when coming into the store to pick them up. This function was designed to make the pickup experience more convenient and drive customer loyalty in the process. 
	In conclusion, with the ever-evolving collection and analytics tools available, agencies and businesses can use data to streamline workflows, help identify fraud, and much more. First impressions matter. No one wants to arrive at a terrible looking website. And more importantly, with the plethora of competitors across industries at a consumer’s disposal, no one has time to browse a terrible looking website. As an online brand, your website is your first impression. While the shopper may find you through a variety of different channels, once they arrive, it’s about convincing them to linger through the “racks,” rather than to pass by the window.
Thank you.
