Introduction

We hear the term “innovation” everywhere and are made to believe in its importance. 
For many of us, innovation means providing ideas out of the blue, leading to significant 
discoveries and achievements. However, there's more to it than that. Many software engineers,
 programmers, developers, MSSA graduates and so on, have been frustrated in lack of opportunities
 to become fully independent, innovative and be risk takers. They are always task with various
 projects or ask to work as a part of a team to accomplish a goal. This paper will discuss how
 this unique group of people can accomplish so much even if they start with something as small 
 as a pet project.  The name of the propose project will be called “Fund_My_Project”.
 
 Data
 
 Fund_My_Project will be a platform or application that will connects developers or programmers
 with various mentors and allow them to seek funding for their projects too. This application 
 will be design to overcome many of the challenges that programmers face such as poor
 requirements, unrealistic schedule, inadequate testing, futurities, or miscommunications.
The first part of the application will be the data. Prospective developers or programmer 
will be required to create an account either as an individual or as a group and fill in
the other necessary background information phone number, address and other information.
then they will also be required to indicate what type of support that they are looking for 
e.g. mentors, donors, coaches, or adviser etc. Donors, advisers, sponsors, mentors and others 
will also fill in their background information as well. 

The User Interface

The user interface will be user friendly. It will easily match programmers or developers with 
their appropriate request or ideas  . E.g. if a developer wants a partner or a mentor, 
the user interface will be able to connect him/her to a prospective partner or mentor. 
Tremendous efficiencies are experienced because of the development and use of new strategies.
One way to experience this is when distinctly different ideas come from different minds. 
Don't be afraid to surround yourself with people who have ideas that differ from yours
or who have a different perspective than yours.
The programming necessary to achieve this will be simple to understand whereby a user inputs 
a data and a request and the program automatically matches the request. Innovation isn’t 
solely represented by new devices, ideas or methods, but also by the process of uncovering 
new ways to do things. This is where the applications will play a big role.

Conclusion

In Conclusion, this platform will help many developers or programmers with organic ideas 
to become more creative. Innovation is one of the most important concerns of each organization
and its role in the development and coordination of the market is inalienable. Innovation 
in all human areas is applicable from product development, methods of management, 
ways of doing works and etc.
