        USE CASE APPLICATION OF APP THAT PAIRS/MATCH MSSA STUDENTS WITH MENTORS.

INTRODUCTION

The Kobo app when fully functional will have the ability to pair MSSA students and other young developers
with the right mentors, coach, sponsors or even companies that may be interested in a candidate's project.
The Kobo abb will be user firendly and easy to navigate. All users and partipants will be required to complete 
a short questionaire and fill in basic information about what they want or expect. The app will also have brief 
description of who the MSSA student or developer is and what they are really looking for and what they hope to 
accomplish through this program. The app will also accomodate people in the community who have a challenge that 
they hope can be solved using technology. Inetersted participants will submit a short description of the problem 
and what they hope to see as an outcome. This paper will examine possible use case scenarios and applicable use 
of this project. 


BODY

The kobo app design mentoring program pairs MSSA students or developers who have expressed an interest in any IT skill
like software deveopment, product development, graphic design, IT infrastructure secuirty etc. with professionals from
the community. Over the course of three to four weeks, the mentoring group meets to discuss any project and the way 
forward and also discuss where they can find resources that will further enhance that project. The whole idea of this 
app is to find suitable mentors or coaches that are interested in giving back to the community by volunteering to mentor
or coach young developers or MSSA students.
There have been similar collaborations out there that tries to tech or mentor interested members of the community more about
tech and how collaborations could help foster community development. A good example of such is the Discover Design Mentoring
program. The Discover Design mentoring program pairs local high school students who have expressed an interest in graphic 
design with professionals from the local design community. Over the course of three to four months, the mentoring group 
meets on weekends to complete individual projects that help them give back to their community through social design. 
some of the projects that the descover design completed are “Get Out the Vote” posters and billboards that promote 
tolerance (Create! Don’t Hate.). They have also carried out projects to help students identify things within their own
schools that they’d like to improve upon (School: by Design). Most recently, the program was involved in the design and
development of an iPad app that encouraged students to get out and explore their community, illustrating cultural hot 
spots around the city. The kobo app will also be just as similar but will have alot more option than the descover 
design mentoring program. Another use case of this app will be in the area of helping young developers that are 
interested in collaboration for a start up.  So many deveopers and students out there are interested in starting their 
own app or company but most people dont have the capital or the resources or the right connections to make their success 
journey a little easier. The kobo app will bridge that gap by providing deveopers with the right mentors, coach, sponsors 
etc that are willing to guide anyone that is interested in any kind of app development or just collaboration. 

CONCLUSION

Coaching, Mentorship, sponsorship, etc are all recognized method for encouraging professional development. Recent
research shows that the best run companies have a diverse mix of talented employees and also most companies discover some
of their talents through this kind of program and that is what the kobo app will aiom to achieve because the goal of the 
kobo app is to build tools that help people get the support they need. Also, Mentorship makes it easier for people to build
relationships that help them reach their goals or targets.
